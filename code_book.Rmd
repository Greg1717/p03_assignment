# Code Book

This document represents the code book for the TidyData set created as a result of the run_analysis_R script.


# Data Source

The source data for the project is the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones** Data Set which was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. Each person (subject) performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measurements at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).


# Data Transformations

Based on the individual datasets a singular tidy dataset has been created (for more details see README.Rmd)

From the tidy dataset the code extracts only the measurements on the **mean** and **standard deviation** for each measurement using **grep**, but also use the first three columns which contain subject label, activity code & activity description

`my_vars_mean_std <- c(1, 2, 3, grep(pattern = "mean|std", x = names(dt_tidy_dataset)))`

The variables determined above are extracted to a separate data.table:

`dt_tidy_mean_std <- dt_tidy_dataset[, ..my_vars_mean_std]`

Create second dataset named dt_averages with **mean** of each variable for each activity and each subject:

`dt_tidy_averages <- dt_tidy_mean_std[, lapply(.SD, mean),`
                                `keyby = .(subject_label, activity_code, activity_descr)]`


# Variables

The final dataset contains the averages of following measurements by subject and activity:

**subject_label** - (integer) ID of subject performing the activity. Ranges from 1 to 30. 

**activity_code** - (integer) ID of activity. Ranges from 1 to 6. 

**activity_descr** - Activity the subject is performing. 6 possible values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

These variables are all of the **mean values** for the corresponding measurement based on the subject and the activity.  These are all of data type **numeric**.
